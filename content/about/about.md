I think the best way to introduce myself and share what I am about, is by sharing what I love doing. I love to learn about how things work. I love to deep-dive, breakdown, and analyze, how a thing, a mechanism, or a process works and build upon them where I can. This proclivity applies to everything I do, for example, I find myself watching behind the scenes of movies than the movies themselves.

My penchant and obsessive curiosity to understand how things work, has been my guiding force throughout my life. Playing with Transformers and Lego when young, evolved into a curiosity for electronics and computers, where I first built my own computer when I  was a teenager.  These interests of mine influenced my decision in taking Electronics and Computer Engineering for my undergrad and grad school.

During my time in college, I dabbled in a myriad of things guided by my curiosity. I published a paper in the [journal of the institution engineers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40030-020-00446-4#citeas)  on particulate matter pollution and built portable device based of an arduino and esp32 that could gather PM2.5 data and stream it to AWS, where my fellow authors ran analysis against. This was my first introduction to the concept of IoT. The concept of things taking to each other to learn from one another and make more efficient decisions, really resonated with me. From this concept's prescriptive previously siloed things can now make decisions based on the other thing's state. The opportunities seemed endless here. 

I dived deep into world of networking to better my understanding on how devices could communicate with each and in the process got a CCNA Cert. During the pandemic, I got the opportunity to intern at a company called Americaneagle.com, a E-commerce Web development company. I was part of the Web-Ops team. Here I got to work with a more stationary IoT device, servers. My time here, is where I got exposed to then tasks that entails from maintaining application server clusters. I got a chance to work on infrastructure and deployment automation using Python and Powershell(they had a lot of windows servers). This is also where I got to dive deeper into understanding all the moving parts of Linux, like systemd services, mdadm for RAID configuration, firewall, and networkd.

After college, I joined Amazon, as a Systems Development Engineer. I'm part of the Managed Edge Compute Team under the Fulfillment Technologies and Robotics Organization. We design, and develop the OS, provisioning mechanism, and device management mechanism for 2+million devices present in Amazon Fulfillment Centers across the globe. When you get an Amazon package, it probably made it's way processed by the systems we built. 

When you are working at Amazon's scale, scale introduces a unique problem set compared to traditional systems. 1 in million type of issues are actually caught and can cause impact. Devices provisioned and managed across the globe need to be reliable and foremost have to operate in a deterministic manner across the entire fleet across the globe. To achieve this, my team and I are building an custom [Image-Based Linux](https://github.com/castrojo/awesome-immutable) OS and provisioning mechanism. I am currently helping build a custom Ubuntu based distribution with A/B style updates and rollbacks, very similar to SteamOS by Valve. There are a myriad of uses cases in Amazon's robotics operation. We are aware there is no one size fits all OS for all these use cases. We are building a customization framework and a full CI/CD mechanism that an robotics application owner can use to build and deploy their own distribution to their fleet of edge devices.

My relentless curiosity, has taken introduced me to some interesting problems, great communities, and pretty cool technologies. Can't wait to see what comes next in this journey.
