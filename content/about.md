Hello,
My name is Vasudevan Perumal.

I'm an computer systems generalist, with a some battle scars(aka experience) in Linux distribution engineering, and building systems to provision and manage devices at scale using cloud-native technologies. Right now, I build cloud-native endpoints for robotics systems at Amazon. What is a cloud-native endpoint you might ask?

Cloud-native endpoints are devices that can be deployed from anywhere. They receive their applications and configurations dynamically from the cloud, and can easily be reset or restored. These systems don't generally require a direct connection to any on-premises resources for usability or management.

To know me better, and what I am about, quick, I think sharing some principles I follow is the best way. Here are some are these principles.
- Always reason from first principles.
- Respect what came before.
- Have strong opinions, but loosely held.
- Be stubborn on the vision, flexible on the approach.
- Iterative improvement, than perfection.
